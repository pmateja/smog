# Smog

## Sending data

Fill config.yaml with your personal data, than just run *send.py* in Raspibian cron in every 15 minutes (or as you like).

## Creating plot

Also fill config.yaml and do the same in your preferred period of time. Make sure you have a Plotly account, it's free for simple use.

## Requirements

Plotly account (you can also make pure html/css/js files out of it, then you don't need to register), InfluxDB, Python3, Rpi (Zero in my case) with internet connection, SDS011 smog sensor - it's a cheap but cool one.
